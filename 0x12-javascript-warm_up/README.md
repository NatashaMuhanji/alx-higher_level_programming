## JavaScript Fundamentals

### Variables

In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They can be declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords, with `var` being scoped to the nearest function, and `let` and `const` being block-scoped.

### Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. Understanding these data types is essential for manipulating data effectively in JavaScript.

### Operators

JavaScript provides operators for performing operations on data. These include arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`), logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`), and assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=` `*=`, `/=`).

### Operator Precedence

Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in expressions. Understanding operator precedence helps in writing expressions that yield the expected results.

### Controlling Program Flow

Control flow statements like `if`, `if ... else`, `while`, `for`, `break`, and `continue` are used to control the execution flow of JavaScript programs based on conditions or loops.

### Functions

Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They can be defined using the `function` keyword and called using their name along with any necessary arguments.

### Objects and Arrays

Objects and arrays are complex data types in JavaScript used to store collections of data. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, while arrays are ordered collections of values. Understanding how to work with objects and arrays is fundamental to JavaScript programming.

### Intrinsic Objects

Intrinsic objects are built-in objects provided by JavaScript, such as `Math`, `Date`, `String`, and `Array`, which offer functionalities for performing common operations.

### Module Patterns

Module patterns in JavaScript are used for organizing and structuring code into modular components. Common module patterns include the Revealing Module Pattern and the ES6 Module Syntax.
